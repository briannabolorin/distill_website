MATH 230: Data Visualization & Computing

While taking this data visualization course, I have learned how to work with data sets in R studio to effectively represent the data and information they hold through a variety of visualizations. In this online portfolio, I share some of my work throughout the Spring 2023 semester and I utilize data visualization to analyze global fuel consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from 1990-2020.
