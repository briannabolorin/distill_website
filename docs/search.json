Shifting to cleaner, renewable energy sources with smaller carbon footprints offers one avenue to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gasses. To look more closely at global CO2 emissions and fuel consumption, I will be presenting data from Enerdata’s data set, “World energy data 1990-2020.” Something to note before moving on is that, in this data set, the only country in the Arab states for which we have data is Algeria.\nHow have average total global CO2 emissions compared to average global CO2 emissions from fuel combustion (1990-2020)?\n\n\n\nFrom 1990 to 2020, we observe a decrease in average total global CO2 emissions from roughly 2.27 ton/Mtoe to roughly 2.13 ton/Mtoe. However, average global CO2 emissions from fuel combustion have increased since 1990: over the 31 years from 1990 to 2020, there was an increase from 475 Mt to 722 Mt of CO2 emitted from fuel combustion.\n\n\n\nWhen looking at the how the distribution of CO2 emissions from fuel combustion changes from 1990-2020 for each region in the histograms above, it is immediately obvious that the most substantial change occurs in Asia & Pacific. The bar that inches towards 10,000 Mt of CO2 emissions from fuel combustion represents China which increased their emissions from 2,255.4 Mt in 1990 to 9,716.772 Mt in 2020.\n\n\nAverage CO2 Emissions from Fuel                                              Combustion (Mt)aRegion19902020ChangeAfrica140.1242.0101.9Arab States53.0135.182.1Asia & Pacific453.21,398.1944.9Europe461.0322.0-139.0Middle east129.8422.0292.2North America2,648.02,460.1-187.8South/Latin America120.4193.873.4aMt = million tons\n\nWhen we take a closer look at average CO2 emissions from fuel combustion by region, we see that Asia & Pacific had the most dramatic increase in average emissions from 453.2 Mt in 1990 to 1,398.1 Mt in 2020. We also see that North America has the highest average CO2 emissions from fuel combustion by far, but it has decreased from 2,648 Mt in 1990 to 2,460.1 Mt in 2020. Europe also managed to slightly lower average CO2 emissions from fuel combustion from 461 Mt in 1990 to 322 Mt in 2020. The rest of the world had smaller average CO2 emissions from fuel combustion, all under 250 Mt, but still increased their emissions from 1990 to 2020.\nFuel Consumption in Different Regions of the World\nUse the drop down menu below to view the domestic consumption of different fuel types around the world from 1990 to 2020.\n\n\nHow Does the Percentage of Electricity Produced by Renewable Resources Impact Overall CO2 Emissions?\n\n\n\nAs expected, on average, a higher percentage of the total electricity produced in a region correlates to lower total CO2 emissions as per the negative correlations suggested by the fitted LOESS lines.\nSummary\nIt is crucial for the emission of greenhouse gasses, like CO2, to be reduced to slow the acceleration of climate change by anthropogenic activities such as the burning of fossil fuels like oil, natural gas, and coal. While climate change is a challenge that must be tackled by nations all over the world, the data from Enerdata suggest that, on average as of 2020, North America is the largest consumer of oil and natural gas. Notably, China has substantially increased their domestic coal consumption from 1990 to 2020 making the Asia & Pacific the largest consumers of domestic coal. The radar plot shown below shows more recent (2015-2020) relative average fossil fuel consumption between different regions.\n\n\n\nAs of 2015-2020, South/Latin America and North America are world leaders in the production of cleaner electricity, each with greater than an average 40% of electricity being generated from renewable resources. Europe and Asia & Pacific follow with an average of 30.8% and 20.5% of electricity that is renewable, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The negative slope of the smooth local regression line shows that, on average, the 2020 car models in this data set that had a higher curb weight tended to take less time accelerating from 0 mph to 30 mph.\n\n\n\n\n2. Histogram with Density Curve\nThis plot was created using data from a paper titled “Are Emily and Greg More Employable Than Lakisha and Jamal? a Field Experiment on Labor Market Discrimination” by Marianne Bertrand and Sendhil Mullainathan. Shown below is a univariate plot consisting of a histogram with bins colored by count that is overlayed with a density plot. This visualization shows the right-skewed distribution of the total years of work experience listed on the resumes in this data set.\n\n\n\n\n3. Density Curves with ggridges\nThe data visualized below were recorded in the Montesinho natural park in Portugal between January 2000 and December 2003. The density curves, with the 2nd and 90th percentiles denoted by vertical lines, show the distribution of temperature in the park given the day of the week.\n\n\n\n\n4. High Density Regions with ggdensity\nBelow is a plot illustrating four different high density regions (HDRs) with rug plots on each axis to show the distribution of each variable. The data comes from the Nutrition Study data set in the Lock5Data package in R. As suggested by the highest density region, most individuals in this study consumed around 1000 \\(\\mu\\)g of dietary retinol per day and had a plasma retinol level of around 500 ng/mL.\n\n\n\n5. Confidence Interval Shiny App\nAs a part of a group project, I worked on developing these interactive visualizations to demonstrate the concepts of confidence intervals and levels to introductory statistics students. Including interactive features allows the user to understand how sampling distributions are constructed, observe how confidence level impacts the width of their respective confidence interval, and how sample size alters the margin of error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
